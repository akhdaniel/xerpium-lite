# Current Stage of the Project

This document outlines the current state of the backend application, including the implemented features, architectural changes, and testing procedures.

## 1. Project Structure Updates

The `models` folder has been moved to `backend/app/base/models` to better organize modules within a "base" module.

## 2. Base Models Enhancement

All models (`User`, `Group`, `AccessRight`, `Menu`) now inherit from a `Base` model defined in `backend/app/base/models/base.py`. This `Base` model automatically includes the following fields:
- `id`: Primary key, integer, indexed.
- `created_at`: DateTime with timezone, automatically set on creation.
- `updated_at`: DateTime with timezone, automatically updated on modification.

Redundant `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` fields were removed from individual model definitions.

## 3. Services Implementation

A `services` directory (`backend/app/base/services`) has been created to encapsulate the business logic for each model. Service files (`user.py`, `group.py`, `access_right.py`, `menu.py`) provide standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for their respective models.

## 4. Schemas for Data Validation

A `schemas` directory (`backend/app/schemas`) has been introduced to define Pydantic models for data validation and serialization. This ensures that data entering and exiting the API conforms to expected structures. Schemas for `User`, `Group`, `AccessRight`, and `Menu` have been created, including `Base`, `Create`, and `Update` variations.

Notably, the `UserUpdate` schema was adjusted to make `username`, `email`, and `password` optional, allowing for partial updates.

## 5. API Endpoints (Routers)

A `routers` directory (`backend/app/routers`) has been created to define the API endpoints for each model. Each model has a corresponding router file (`user.py`, `group.py`, `access_right.py`, `menu.py`) that handles HTTP requests and interacts with the services layer.

These routers are integrated into the main FastAPI application in `backend/main.py` using `app.include_router`, with appropriate prefixes and tags (e.g., `/users`, `/groups`).

## 6. Testing Setup and Execution

A `tests` folder (`backend/app/base/tests`) has been created to house unit and integration tests for the API endpoints.

### Dependencies

The following testing dependencies are required and listed in `backend/app/base/tests/requirements.txt`:
- `pytest`
- `httpx`

### Test File: `test_user.py`

The `test_user.py` file contains comprehensive tests for the `User` API endpoints, covering:
- User creation (successful and with existing email).
- Reading users (all and by ID, including non-existent users).
- Updating users (successful and non-existent users).
- Deleting users (successful and non-existent users).

### Database Isolation for Tests

To ensure test isolation and a clean state for each test run, a `db_session` fixture has been implemented in `test_user.py`. This fixture:
- Creates all database tables before a test.
- Provides a SQLAlchemy session to the test.
- Drops all database tables after the test.

Additionally, an `override_get_db_fixture` is used to ensure that the FastAPI application's database dependency (`get_db`) uses the isolated session provided by `db_session` during tests.

### Running Tests

To run the tests:

1.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment** in the `backend` directory (if not already done):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv backend/.venv
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source backend/.venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    backend\.venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
2.  **Install main project dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Install test dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r backend/app/base/tests/requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Ensure `backend` is treated as a Python package** by having an empty `__init__.py` file in the `backend` directory.
5.  **Run pytest from the project root**, setting the `PYTHONPATH` to include the project root:
    ```bash
    PYTHONPATH=/Users/daniel/data/xerpium1 /Users/daniel/data/xerpium1/backend/.venv/bin/pytest /Users/daniel/data/xerpium1/backend/app/base/tests/test_user.py
    ```
    (Replace `/Users/daniel/data/xerpium1` with your actual project root path.)

## 7. Key Changes and Fixes Summary

-   **Models Folder Relocation**: `backend/app/models` moved to `backend/app/base/models`.
-   **Standardized Base Model**: All models inherit `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at` from a common `Base`.
-   **Import Path Adjustments**: Corrected import statements across services, routers, and tests to reflect the new structure and ensure proper package resolution.
-   **`Menu` Model Relationship Fix**: Corrected `remote_side` definition in `Menu` model's relationship to `parent = relationship("Menu", remote_side='Menu.id', backref="children")`.
-   **`UserUpdate` Schema Refinement**: Made `username`, `email`, and `password` fields optional in `UserUpdate` Pydantic schema to support partial updates.
-   **Robust Testing Environment**: Implemented database clearing fixtures for isolated and reliable test execution.
